I'm faculty at the School of Arts, Media and Engineering and I teach several classes in the Digital Culture Program. The best way to contact me is by email.

My research work is in the areas of mixed reality rehabilitation, interaction architecture, and media systems for education. Prior to joining the School of Arts, Media and Engineering, I spent 16 years creating animation and effects for film and television. During that time I was honored to win eight Rocky Mountain Emmy Awards.
