I'm faculty at the School of Arts, Media + Engineering and I teach several classes in the Digital Culture Program. The best way to contact me is by email. loren.olson@asu.edu

My research work is in the areas of mixed reality rehabilitation, interaction architecture, and media systems for education. Prior to joining the School of Arts, Media and Engineering, I spent 16 years creating animation and effects for film and television. During that time I was honored to win eight Rocky Mountain Emmy Awards.

Yada, yada, yada.
