### AME 230 Programming for Media Arts

Introductory level course in practical aspects of programming systems for Media Arts. No previous programming experience is required. The course explores techniques in programming in the context of images, sounds, interaction, networking and data visualization. Students will create images, animations, and interactive programs, and learn how to use images, movies, sound files, microphones and cameras in their programs.

*Programming for Media Arts is scheduled to be taught every Spring.*


### AME 430 Mac Development for Media Arts

This course explores macOS native application development in the domain of Media Arts. The course is project based, and covers the native Xcode development environment, and the Swift programming language. Native applications are able to achieve the highest levels of performance, they leverage the unique technologies built for a platform, and they are able to participate in the native user experience (look & feel) that all users of a popular platform expect. To understand native apps for macOS, the course will examine a number of code frameworks provided for developers by Apple (the core of which are often called Cocoa), including (but not limited to) Foundation, AppKit, AV Foundation, Core Animation and SpriteKit.

*I recommend that students have some programming experience before you take this class. If you haven't programmed before, consider taking Programming for Media Arts first.*


### AME 494/598 Mobile Development

This course explores native application development for iOS for use in the domain of Media Arts. The course is project based, and covers the native Xcode development environment, and the Swift programming language. Native applications are able to achieve the highest levels of performance, they leverage the unique technologies built for a platform, and they are able to participate in the native user experience (look & feel) that all users of a popular platform expect. Applications for mobile devices, usually held in the hand, with a touch based user interface, and relatively constrained resources present a significantly different development environment compared to the conventional desktop environment.

*I recommend that students have some programming experience before you take this class. If students haven't programmed before, consider taking Programming for Media Arts first. In addition, it is best to take Mac Development for Media Arts before this course, in order to be familiar with Xcode and Swift.*


### AME 494/598 Animating Virtual Worlds

This course explores procedural animation. How to create animation using code. Topics include randomness and Perlin noise, simple physics models for animation, particle systems, autonomous agents, steering behaviors and flocking. We use the [Processing](http://processing.org) programming language, an accessible yet powerful environment for learning how to program.

*I recommend that students have some programming experience before you take this class. If students haven't programmed before, consider taking Programming for Media Arts first.*


### AME 485/486 Digital Culture Capstone

Senior capstone projects in digital culture are interdisciplinary team projects that offer experience in diverse collaborations for solving complex problems, a proficiency widely demanded by employers. Students integrate, extend and apply information, principles, theories and/or methods learned in previous courses while supervised by a capstone faculty.

### Critviz

Critviz is a web application I created with David Tinapple. We made Critviz based on our own desire to include critiscm and peer evaluation in our Digital Culture classes, despite the growing enrollment.

[Critviz is now available for anyone to use.](https://critviz.com)


### Digital Culture Summer Institute

Young adults are immersed in digital culture, but most are not familiar with the computational thinking behind the latest tools and technologies. There are few opportunities in K­12 curricula for students to learn such practices, but we believe that skills such as computational thinking, creative coding, collaboration, innovation, and information literacy can be taught in a highly effective manner by using aesthetic challenges as a motivation. In other words, by engaging students in creative digital arts projects they are naturally driven to acquire many new skills that are simply required by the digital tools in order to achieve their aesthetic goals. We are working to create a project ­based digital arts curriculum through which novice middle/high school students are intrinsically motivated to learn and apply STEM skills and computational thinking.


### Eval

Eval is a web application used to track collaboration in research and education at AME. [http://eval.ame.asu.edu](http://eval.ame.asu.edu)


### Learning Environments

Learning Environments is a research group focusing on new approaches to education that harness emerging technologies, enable collaborative learning, and prepare students for an increasingly dynamic world. The group has created several projects exploring physical and online learning systems.
