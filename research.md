### Critviz

Critviz is a web application I created with David Tinapple. We made Critviz based on our own desire to include critiscm and peer evaluation in our Digital Culture classes, despite the growing enrollment.

[Critviz is now available for anyone to use.](https://critviz.com)

### Digital Culture Summer Institute

Young adults are immersed in digital culture, but most are not familiar with the computational thinking behind the latest tools and technologies. There are few opportunities in K­12 curricula for students to learn such practices, but we believe that skills such as computational thinking, creative coding, collaboration, innovation, and information literacy can be taught in a highly effective manner by using aesthetic challenges as a motivation. In other words, by engaging students in creative digital arts projects they are naturally driven to acquire many new skills that are simply required by the digital tools in order to achieve their aesthetic goals. We are working to create a project ­based digital arts curriculum through which novice middle/high school students are intrinsically motivated to learn and apply STEM skills and computational thinking.
