<h2>Teaching</h2>

<h3>AME 230 Programming for Media Arts</h3>
<p>
	Introductory level course in practical aspects of programming systems for Media Arts. No previous programming experience is required. The course explores techniques in programming in the context of images, sounds, interaction, networking and data visualization. We use the Processing programming language, an accessible yet powerful environment for learning how to program. Students will create images, animations, and interactive programs, and learn how to use images, movies, sound files, microphones and cameras in their programs.<br>
	<small><em>Programming for Media Arts is scheduled to be taught every Spring.</em></small>
